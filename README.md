This is my art website which allows you to log in to an account and view some of the artwork displayed.


IMPORTANT:
---------
-This project will no longer be updated. The repository will serve as a showcase for what I ahve been working on for the past couple of months. The app will be replaced by one more robust and interactive in the future.

-Only the login functionality works, the signup feature doesn't function and will not be patched.


Features:
-to try out the login feature, type in honeybuns for the username and 12345 for the password. 
-This app utilizes local storage to let the app know if a user is logged in and to fetch the name of the user. I've utilized a locally stored loginTabFlag variable which switches between null and 1 depending on if the user is logged in or not. Despite the fact that the username is also
stored in the local storage, it practically serves no purpose.
