This is my art website which allows you to log into an account and view some of the artwork displayed.


IMPORTANT:
---------
-This project will no longer be updated. The repository will serve as a showcase for what I ahve been working on for the past couple of months. The app will be replaced by one more robust and interactive in the future.

-Only the login functionality works, the signup feature doesn't function and will not be patched.


Features:
---------
-To try out the login feature, type in honeybuns for the username and 12345 for the password. 
-This app utilizes local storage to let the it know if a user is logged in and to fetch the name of the user. I've utilized a locally stored loginTabFlag variable which switches between null and 1 depending on if the user is logged in or not. Despite the fact that the username is also
stored in the local storage and is retrieved by the app, it practically serves no purpose.
